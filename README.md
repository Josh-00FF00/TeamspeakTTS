# TeamspeakTTS

This is a _very_ simple TTS engine I've added for windows only. It should probably work on all Windows versions since Vista.

## Features
* Can't get enough of your teammates voices and want to hear their awful text messages as well? Now you can.
* Ability to mute this ^ (Quickly added after user testing resulted in a _bad_ experience).
* Grabs the domain name of posted URLs so you're not blasted with a 1000 character long url that someone badly copied into chat.

## Commands
Currently there are a few options that are accessed by typing "/tts" into chat.

/tts toggle mute (mutes tts from chat)
/tts toggle talkback (allows you to hear your own chat messages)


/tts set maxlength 100 (Sets the maxlength of a message that will be read)
/tts set maxqueue 5 (Sets the number of messages saved to be read out, oldest removed first)

That's it!
